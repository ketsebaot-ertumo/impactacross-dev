      description: "Ethiopia&apos;s natural resources, namely oil, gas and minerals, fisheries, and forests, have a potential to bring wealth and stability to the country. The governance of these resources has emerged as one of the defining challenges for 21st century policy development. At abbabor, we recognize that norms, institutions, processes determine how power and responsibilities over natural resources are exercised and how citizens participate in and benefit from the management of natural resources. It is the understanding of these factors and our use of political economy/political ecology approaches that enable us to effectively analyze the underlying challenges of natural resources management and provide tailored solutions to problems.",
