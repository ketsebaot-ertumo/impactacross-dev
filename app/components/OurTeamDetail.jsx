From 2010-2011, he lectured in Political Economy at UCT&apos;s Political Studies Department. During 2012, Ross worked as a researcher in Parliament. Since June 2013, he has been a senior researcher with SAIIA&apos;s Governance of Africa&apos;s Resources Programme (GARP) in Cape Town. Ross hopes that his research will shape the institutional elements &ndash; norms, beliefs and rules &ndash; that motivate policymaker behaviour in a direction that benefits ordinary Africans.",
